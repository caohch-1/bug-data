F1 is a fault that occurs in using asynchronous tasks, when we send messages asynchronously without message sequence control.
Suppose we have event A and event B that occurs in a service. Event A is always processed and return earlier than Event B.
But sometimes, due to some specific reasons, Event A is received and processed later than Event B. Then a fault will occur.


train_ticket replicated fault description:

In the ticket cancel function in ticket system, we have two major event: [Drawback Money] and [Reset Order Status].
If the user decided to cancel a order, the Cancel-Service firstly call Inside-Payment-Service to drawback money.
Then Inside-Payment-Service call Order-Service to set the order status to CANCELLING. Then drawback the money.
After that, the Cancel-Service call Order-Service set the order status to CANCEL. Then the whole cancel process done.
In our fault reproduction, we had a random delay to send event [Drawback Money] to simulate the situation of network congestion.
In this case, the event [Reset Order Stauts] will completed before [Drawback Money], then the fault occurs.
