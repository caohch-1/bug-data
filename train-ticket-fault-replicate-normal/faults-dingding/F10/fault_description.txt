train_ticket replicated fault description:

In our Train Ticket System, the name and the ID Card number is required for booking a ticket.
In our society, one ID card number only mapping one name.
Thus, if two user input two distinct name but the document number is same, one of the user must be rejected.
In our system, if one  document number has been occupied by one name, another user inputs the same document number but
another name, he/she still successfully gets a ticket.
In this scenario, a logic fault like F10 occurs.
