F5 is such kind of fault that caused by the resource competition of multiple request.
Sometimes a microservice has its maximum number of connections.
Suppose we have 3 services, A, B, C. A and B both call C for some specific information.
If A send some requests to C, but before that B has sent some requests to C and these requests are too complex to process at a short time, then
the requests from A must wait until the requests from B completed, leading to a timeout exception.



train_ticket replicated fault description:

We implemented this fault in Basic-Info-Service. 
We use asynchronous tasks in Basic-Info-Service to collect tickets information.
Then we use the thread pool which is needed for the implementation of asynchronous tasks as microservice resource.
We send many requests at a short period of time and if the thread number is equal or exceeds the max-thread-pool-size, the fault will occur.
