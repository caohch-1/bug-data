train_ticket replicated fault description:

In ticket system, the user could create new contacts when selecting contacts.
For different contacts, one ID-Number can only mapping to one contacts.
If the contacts database is empty, he could create a contact without any ID-Number check.
However, if the database is not empty, for every request to add contacts, the duplication of ID-Number
